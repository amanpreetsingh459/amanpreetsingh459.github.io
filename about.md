*Tata Consultancy Services, 01/2017 - 02/2019*
- Responsibilities:
  - Developing, maintaining, enhancing the ETL components (ingestion, transformation, export) of the data pipeline
  - Writing data transformation rules as hive queries to run through pyspark jobs
  - Maintaining the end-to-end oozie workflow for this entire process

- Achievements:
  - Successfully upgraded the data warehousing solution tasks from teradata relational database to the hadoop environment.
     - Success measure: Made it scalable for the ever-growing database size in much more cost-effective way
  - Optimized the data processing (batch processing) run time into hadoop environment from 4 hours to just 40 minutes

#### Systems Engineer - Middleware Engineering

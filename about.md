### EXPERIENCE
#### AI/ML Specialist
*Google, 08/2022 - present*
- Artificial Intelligence/Machine Learning in Google Cloud

#### Consultant – Data Science
*Infosys, 02/2019 - 08/2022*
- As company’s central automation team member finding the opportunities of automation into different accounts. Then building the same end-to-end using data-driven approaches
- Winner of the EMNLP 2020, FIFTH CONFERENCE ON MACHINE TRANSLATION (WMT20) competition in the similar language translation task category. Link to the published paper of solution: [https://www.aclweb.org/anthology/2020.wmt-1.52/](https://www.aclweb.org/anthology/2020.wmt-1.52/)
- Deployed multiple pre-trained text-classification models as rest endpoints
- Developed an email classification model and deployed it as an add-in in MS Outlook. This helped with quick decision-making about the trading functions

#### Systems Engineer - Big Data Engineering
*Tata Consultancy Services, 01/2017 - 02/2019*
- Maintaining and enhancing big data pipeline for ETL workflow (ingestion, transformation, export) used for dashboard reporting
- Successfully migrated the data warehousing workflows from the teradata database to the hadoop environment. This made it scalable for the ever-growing database size in a very cost-effective way
- Optimized the data processing (batch processing) run time into hadoop environment from 4 hours to just 40 minutes

#### Systems Engineer - Middleware Engineering
*Tata Consultancy Services, 03/2015 - 01/2017*
- Maintaining the health of 402 servers (Unix / Linux, Windows) to ensure MQ (IBM Message Queuing) services are operational all the time
- Automated the process of manually logging into the servers and performing troubleshooting activities of MQ components (queue managers, queues etc.), by building a desktop-based UI
- Automated the process of running manual, periodic health-checks on the servers. This reduced the 90% manual effort for doing the same otherwise
